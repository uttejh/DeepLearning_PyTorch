# Deep Learning with PyTorch
This repository contains material related to Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. It consists of a bunch of notebooks for various deep learning topics.

## Built With
- PyTorch
- Python 3
- Google Colab

## Table Of Contents
### Introduction to Neural Networks
* **Introduction to Neural Networks**: implemented gradient descent and applied it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* **Sentiment Analysis with NumPy**: built sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* **Introduction to PyTorch**: built neural networks in PyTorch and used pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Visualized the output of layers that make up a CNN. Defined and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, defined and trained a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* **Transfer Learning**: used VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
* **Weight Initialization**: Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* **Style Transfer**: Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implemented style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Defined appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design

### Recurrent Neural Networks

* **Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)**: implemented RNN in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.
* **Embeddings (Word2Vec)**: Implemented the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* **Sentiment Analysis RNN**: Implemented a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.

### Deploying a Model (with AWS SageMaker)

* Learnt to deploy pre-trained models using AWS SageMaker.
